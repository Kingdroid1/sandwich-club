# Sandwich Club Project 

## Project Overview
In this project, the **Sandwich Club** app has been completed to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

## Why this Project

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project has
helped me to better understand how it is processed.

## What I Learned?
Through this project, I:
- Learned how to submit projects for review
- Practiced JSON parsing to a model object
- Designed an activity layout
- Populated all fields in the layout accordingly
